This project began as a way to become more familiar with os functions in Python. The current version takes a list of URLs and for each source URL creates a YouTube item, downloads the audio file, and saves it to the destination folder as a .mp3 file.

Future updates include: 1) creating a Song class to store the song title, artist, and album information and 2) updating the file metadata of the .mp3 to include the information in the Song class.

This project was pretty engaging, and helped me practice the whole process from breaking the problem down into steps and sub-steps, researching packages that I can use to do what I need, and debugging.
